## Specification: Basic Calculator

The objective or scope of our domain is to be able to compute and simplify basic mathematical operations following order of operations.

### Introduction

To narrow down our scope, currently our project will be able to take in a mathematical expression, compute the answer, and output the answer.

### Breakdown

1. Users will be able to type in a basic mathematical statement, such as ```2+2```
2. The program will then process the input, and solve for the answer
3. Then, the program will display the output in the console.

### Conclusion

Our current goal is to get the basic operations working, and having an input and output.

### Future Ideas

Integrate, Linear Algebra, and potentially Calculus operations into our calculator. For the UI, we hope to have a website completed!
