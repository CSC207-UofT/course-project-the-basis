## Project Specification

Below is the Specifiation for the entire project!

### Introduction

Our goal is to create a website mathematical utility. It will contain features from basic operations to Linear Algebra topics such as RREF.

### Breakdown

1. Users will open the website, and be presented with a clean UI where they can type in an expresssion. For Linear Algebra, we plan on creating a button which will switch the page to a matrix friendly input.
2. Users will input their requested problem, and in the background the code will process, compute and return the correct answer!
3. In terms of users and history, users will have the option to create a username/password account where their history will be stored. All of the storing will be done in the background.

### Conclusion

Now that we are on Phase 1, we hope to further extend from our current project. Adding users, history, linear algebra and a website are in mind for Phase 1.


## Specification for Phase 0: Basic Calculator

Below is the breakdown of our specification for Phase 0!

### Introduction

To narrow down our scope, currently our project will be able to take in a mathematical expression, compute the answer, and output the answer. The expressions will be computed following order of operations.

Currently, addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication are all supported. This was done to keep our scope speific for Phase 0.

### Breakdown

1. Users will be able to type in a basic mathematical statement, such as ```2+2```
2. The program will then process the input, and solve for the answer
3. Then, the program will display the output in the console.

### Conclusion

Our current goal is to get the basic operations working, and having an input and output.

### Future Ideas

Integrate, Linear Algebra, and potentially Calculus operations into our calculator. For the UI, we hope to have a website completed!
