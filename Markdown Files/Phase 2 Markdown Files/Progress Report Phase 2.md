## What has worked well for your design?

> What worked well was splitting up our code into Use Cases, and having a controller. This made is a lot easier to see how we can implement features such as user log-in and sign-up. Alongside, packaging by layers to see how our classes interact with each other. Another design choice which worked well was having a gateway to communicate with our txt files for Users and History. The design patterns implemented are discussed in our Design Report and were all helpful in our design as described in the report.
## Summary of what each group member is working on and plans on working on next

> For Phase 2, my main responsibility was converting our code to follow SOLID, Clean Architecture and use Design Patterns. In Phase 1 we did not pay attention to this as much as we should have, so I took the responsibility of implementing these into our code and guiding our group in implementing these properties. For example, I split up the WalkThroughCustomInput into use cases, made a controller for our calculator, and implemented design patterns. I also packaged our code as mentioned in the Design Report. I also completed the design report, and created the layout for the Phase 2 homepage section on our Github page.

> In this Phase, I looked at the feedback given form phase 1 and implemented the stratgey pattern for our comupte method in our program. Making an interface then implementing it in each operation with its own class such as additon, subtraction, muliplication, etc. I then made a class that checks the operand then assign's its functionaily based on the operand that was given. Esenitally, this is the backbone of our program as everything else needs it in order for our program to work so the deign must be very friendly. I also made modifed test cases to fit our new design as the old cases did not cover this. I also designed and did some of the accessibilty report.

> The bulk of my work came from implementing the new UI as well as the controller of our program. I also implemented the login and signup features and fixed the issues we had with implementation of our database (how we saved a user's calculation, as well as they're username/password).
> https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-the-basis/commit/43b457b91c2ee54c493684c51a950dc770df02f4 : This is where I created a database for the history part of our program and implemented it. This helped us resolve some of the big issues we were having in phase 1 when trying to set up a proper database without breaking any clean architecture principles.

> In Phase 2 I brought about lots of code changes, I worked alongside Hamza Nur to bring about proper computation to our program. Nearly all functionality of our program relies heavily on the algorithms and methods that I created. Several design features of Operators and Parser classes have been created to allow for computations. In particular, the commit https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-the-basis/commit/30d1fdde95994c227015bf755ad9c51daa53a323 contains lots of important additions to our project which fundamentally enables our project to operate.
