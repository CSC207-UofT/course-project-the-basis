## What has worked well for your design?

> What worked well was splitting up our code into Use Cases, and having a controller. This made is a lot easier to see how we can implement features such as user log-in and sign-up. Alongside, packaging by layers to see how our classes interact with each other. Another design choice which worked well was having a gateway to communicate with our txt files for Users and History. The design patterns implemented are discussed in our Design Report and were all helpful in our design as described in the report.

> For Phase 2, my main responsibility was converting our code to follow SOLID, Clean Architecture and use Design Patterns. In Phase 1 we did not pay attention to this as much as we should have, so I took the responsibility of implementing these into our code and guiding our group in implementing these properties. For example, I split up the WalkThroughCustomInput into use cases, made a controller for our calculator, and implemented design patterns. I also packaged our code as mentioned in the Design Report. I also completed the design report, and created the layout for the Phase 2 homepage section on our Github page.
