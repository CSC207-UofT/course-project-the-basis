## Question 1

### Equitable Use
> Our program does implement the principle of equitable use. All users for the program have a unique username with a unique password. So privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users without segregating. Usernames are attained by first-come first-served basis.
###  Flexibility in Use
> As our program is now, there is only one language option for users to pick from. To accommodate and give more flexiblity to the user in the future we will implement an option which gives the user multiple languages to choose from. This allows more flexibility to the user and is a useful feature to add.  
### Simple and Intuitive Use
> Our program adheres to the Simple and intuitive principle. The program design is very simplistic and easy to use. The user after logging in will be prompted to either choose to compute a mathematical expression or apply operation to a matrix. There is no unnecessary complexity and it is very user-friendly for people with any level of literacy and language skills

### Perceptible Information
> TODO
### Tolerance for Error
>  Our code provides warnings errors when the user types in an incorrect password, or existing username. However, for the future we could add a checker which would prevent the code from crashing for any incorrect input, such as a character for a number. This would adhere to tolerance for error since it would provide feedback to the user so they know how to type in a valid input, and would not discourage the user from trying again since the program would not crash. 


### Low Physical Effort
> Our program does not have most aspects in this principle because they are physical principles. However, our program does have Minimizing repetitive actions. Our program at the moment does not apply to this feature because our UI is a repetitive prompt for the user's input. We could overcome this in the future by implementing our website so that the user would not have to repeatedly answer prompts.
### Size and Space for Approach and Use
> TODO

## Question 2

> We would market our program towards students taking math courses. Since our program is a calculator, it makes sense to target students in school enrolled in math courses since they can use our Calculator for their homework, assignments, and even just to double check any small calculations. Another target audience is students enrolled in Linear Algebra courses. Since our calculator has a Linear Algebra option which allows operations with matrices, it would be a perfect program since you can check your RREF matrix, or add/subtract two matrices.
>It is important to note that we are not targeting linear algebra students only, but having Linear Algebra Operations in our calculator allows us to invite them to use our program!

## Question 3

> Yes, our calculator is less likely to be used by people who are no longer in school. This includes graduates, retired people, and. children. Since our calculator is aimed towards students taking math courses, it makes sense that people no are not in school would not be intereted or not use our program.
