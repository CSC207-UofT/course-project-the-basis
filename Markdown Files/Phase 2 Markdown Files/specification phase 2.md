## Specification for Phase 2: Basic + Linear Algebra Calculator

Below is the breakdown of our specification for Phase 2!

### Introduction

For Phase 2, our code is able to compute basic operations using addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. From Phase 1 to Phase 2, we added linear algebra support so that the user can compute operations using matrices.

### Breakdown

1. User will be prompted to Sign Up or Log In
2. Once Step 1 is completed, the User will have the option to compute a basic operation, or linear algebra.
3. If basic, then the code will process an operation such as "2 + 2", save this operation to the user's history, and print the final value, in this case "4".
4. If linear algebra, then the user will be able to fill in a matrix, and select from a few operations such as RREF, Determinant, and INverse.
5. Once Step 3 or Step 4 is completed, then the user has the choice to view History, Close the Calculator, or Switch Accounts.

### Conclusion

Overall, our calculator is much more advanced compared to Phase 1. It supports linear algebra, swapping accounts and viewing history now!

### Future Ideas

For the future, we would have connected the Front End to our backend, however due to time contractions this was not possible.
