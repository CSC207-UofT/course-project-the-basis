## Specification for Phase 2: Basic + Linear Algebra Calculator

Below is the breakdown of our specification for Phase 2!

### Introduction

For Phase 2, our code is able to compute basic operations using addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and exponents. From Phase 1 to Phase 2, we added linear algebra support so that the user can compute operations using matrices.

### Breakdown

1. User will be prompted to Sign Up or Log In
2. Once Step 1 is completed, the User will have the option to compute a basic operation, linear algebra operation, or view their history.
3. If basic is selected, then the code will process an operation such as "2 + 2", save this operation to the user's history, and output the final value. So in this case, "4".
4. If linear algebra is selected, then the user will be able to type in a matrix, and select from a few operations such as RREF, adding matrices, and subtracting matrices.
5. If history is selected, the users history will be displayed.
6. After Step 3, 4 or 5, the user will have the option to go back to the main menu, or to close the calculator.

### Conclusion

Overall, our calculator is simple to use, and will be helpful for students interested in mathematics!

### Future Ideas

For the future, we would have connected the Front End to our Back End, however due to time contractions this was not possible. However, the Front End was completed and supports LaTeX!
