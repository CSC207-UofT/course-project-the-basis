## Updated Specification

Briefly highlight any additional functionality that you have implemented between phase 0 and the end of phase 1.


Optionally, include a well-formatted diagram of your code. This is called a class diagram (Links to an external site.), and there is an international standard called the Unified Modelling Language (Links to an external site.) (UML) that describes them in detail. However! Please don't worry about the details, just use boxes and arrows like we do in the slides. If you're curious, you can create a full UML class diagram for all or part (at your group's discretion) of your program.
NOTE 1: This can really help your TA understand what you did, but if presented poorly it won't be of much use.
NOTE 2: If you have access to the Pro version of IntelliJ, it can generate class diagrams for you, but make sure it is well formatted if you hand one in!
