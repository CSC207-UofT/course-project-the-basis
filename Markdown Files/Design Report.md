## SOLID

How well does your design adhere to the SOLID design principles?

> Answer here

Give us specific examples of how your design adheres to the SOLID principles.

> Answer here

If you found that something in your design wasn't good, tell us about that too!
Pretending part of your design is good — when you know it isn't — can potentially hurt your mark significantly!
Acknowledging bad design can earn you marks and demonstrates understanding — especially if you discuss how you could fix it if you had more time!

## Clean Architecture

Is your program consistent with Clean Architecture?

> Answer here

Show us with something like a CRC model or UML diagram.
Describe a scenario walk-through and highlight how it demonstrates Clean Architecture.

> Answer here

Are there any clear violations if we were to randomly look at the imports in a few of your files?

> Answer here 

Is the Dependency Rule consistently followed when interacting with details in the outer layer?

> Answer here

Give us a concrete example from something like your UI or an interaction with a database.

## Design Patterns

Has your group used design patterns in appropriate places in the code? Identified and described any patterns that could be applied in future with more time?

> Answer here

Have you clearly indicated where the pattern was used and possibly pointed out which Pull Request it was implemented in?
Be careful that there aren't any obvious places a design pattern should have been applied that your group forgot to mention.

## Use of GitHub Features

Did your group make an effort to use some of the various features of GitHub to facilitate development of your code?

> Answer here

Issues?
Actions?
Pull Requests?

> Answer here

### Code Style and Documentation

Are there any warnings when the code is opened in IntelliJ?
> Answer here

Fix them as you go!
Is Javadoc used where needed?
Document as you go!
If a Java programmer were to open your repo and navigate to a random file, would they be able to understand your code?
Review each other's Pull Requests as you go!

> Answer here

## Testing

Are most components of your system tested? Are there any components that would be difficult to test due to your design?
We know time is tight in the project, so it is fine if you don't test everything if your group decides to focus on other aspects of the program, but we want to see evidence of testing.
A significant portion of your code should be tested to earn full marks for this (run your tests with coverage to check).

## Refactoring

Is there evidence that your team has refactored code in a meaningful way during the project?
Point to specific Pull Requests!
This could even be applying a design pattern to code you wrote in phase 0!

> Answer here

Are there any obvious code smells still in your code that you missed fixing?
> Answer here


## Code Organization

Is your code organized in a meaningful way? Is it easy to find things in your package structure?

> Answer here

Tell us about how you decided to organize your code and why!

> Answer here

## Functionality

Does your program do what the specification says it should do?
Demo your program's functionality to your TA or make a short video!

> Answer here

Is the functionality sufficiently ambitious, given the size of your group?

> Answer here

Can your program store state and load state? I.e. Can the state persist across runs of your program?
