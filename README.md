# The Basis

Welcome to our project! Below is a breakdown of our project and the stages we will complete. 

## Domain

The domain of our project is a mathematical calculator which is hosted on the web as a utility. We have completed expressions which are solved following order of operations.

## Phase 0

The classes worked on and used in Phase 0 are: [WalkthroughCustomInput](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-the-basis/blob/main/src/main/java/WalkthroughCustomInput.java), [InputProcessor](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-the-basis/blob/main/src/main/java/InputProcessor.java), [Expression](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-the-basis/blob/main/src/main/java/Expression.java), [ExpressionHandler](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-the-basis/blob/main/src/main/java/ExpressionHandler.java), and [CalculatorTest](https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-the-basis/blob/main/src/test/java/CalculatorTest.java). These classes stem from the specifation.
