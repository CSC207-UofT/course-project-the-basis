## Specification: Basic Calculator

The objective or scope of our domain is to be able to compute and simplify basic mathematical operations using BEDMAS

### Introduction

To narrow down our scope, currently our project will be able to take in a mathematical statement, compute the answer, and output the answer.

### Breakdown

1. Users will be able to type in a basic mathematical statement such as 2+2
2. The program will then process the input, and solve for the answer
3. Then, once enter/AC is clicked, the answer is displayed

### Conclusion

Our current goal is to get the basic operations working, and having an input and output

### Future Ideas

Integrate, Linear Algebra, and potentially Calculus operation into our calculator.
