## Specification: Calculator for Math Students

As a brief summary, our project is aimed towards students enrolled in mathematic courses which cover topics in 
calculus and linear algebra.

### Introduction

A problem we have faced is that when we want to check homework, online calculators are scattered all 
over the place, and it makes it hard to ensure there are no mistakes in a short amount of time.

Calculus and Linear Algebra are the two most popular topics and having both topics and their corresponding 
calculators into one application will help students save time by allowing them to understand their mistakes in a shorter 
amount of time, which in return gives students more time to study/review material. 

### Breakdown

1. Students will be presented with the option to use either a basic calculator, linear algebra calculator or a calculus calculator.
2. Once a topic is selected, there will be a list of calculators. For example, in calculus there will be options such as integral solver, and a find the derivative calculator. 
3. Then, there will be the option to place an input, which then the app will process accordingly and output the result!
4. We also plan on having the option to retrieve previous calculations from a "History" section

### Conclusion

Since the specification is in early stages, things are subject to change. However, our project will follow the main idea of this specification!
