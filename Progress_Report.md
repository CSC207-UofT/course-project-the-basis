# Progress Report

Our domain is a calculator website utility, and below are the contents of the progress report!


## Specification

In short, our goal for phase 0 was to narrow down onto a specific goal so that we could have a strong starting point. Currently, our calculator is able to compute basic operations such as addition, subtraction, divistion and multiplication using a custom input, recursion and outputs the correct answer!

## CRC Model

## Scenario Walk-through

## Skeleton Code

For our skeleton code, we focused on getting the 4 basic operations to work correctly with order of operations. We also made a controller class which can take in a custom input, and output the correct answer.

## Open Question we are stuggling with

## What has worked well for our design?

> My contributations mainly came from the implementations of the code, as well as some design choices. I also constructed the Fraction class which is responsible for creating the fractions in our calculator. To the overall project i made changes which improved functionality of the calculator.
