#Progress Report

Our domain is a calculator website utility, and below are the contents of the progress report!

## Summaries

Below are summaries of the specifiation, CRC models, and walkthrough

#### Specification

In short, our goal for phase 0 was to narrow down onto a specific goal so that we could have a strong starting point. Currently, our calculator is able to compute basic operations such as addition, subtraction, divistion and multiplication using a custom input, recursion and outputs the correct answer!
